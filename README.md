# StellarPlayer

A MOD & S3M Player for the Texas Instruments StellarisÂ® LM4F120 launch pad evaluation kit.

I take minimal credit for this project. This is simply a modified version of the Stellaris mod player by Ronen K. 
Which in turn was based on a similar implementation on the PIC32 by Serveur Perso.
